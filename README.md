# RadonTestManager
<b> An app I'm building for my sister. She wanted a way to better manage an inventory her company has and I thought I could make an app for that. Now I'm too far in to turn back now. </b>

## Summary
I am following along with the book [Hands On Full Stack Development wiht ASP.NET Core](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-full-stack-web-development-aspnet-core "Packt Wesite") but tailoring it to my needs.
Commit messages may chronicle my musings and lessons learned/objectives achieved. I am using this app as a learning project to test my grit in C# and .NET. I try to work on it at least one hour a day before the family wakes up but generally average 1.5 hours of work/day. I am open to requests/suggestions/comments. 

I am using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test my API as I go.

Also am using SQL Server in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container on my local machine for testing.

[Swagger](https://swagger.io) is used to document the API.
