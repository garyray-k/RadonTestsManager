# Blazor!

I'm using the *Experimental* [Blazor](https://blazor.net) to build a **hopefully** JS-less dynamic website. Right now the biggest issue is no Authentication handling that I've found yet so I may have to write some JS interop to do it.

## Using

[BionicFramework](https://bionicframework.github.io/Documentation/)
[Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
